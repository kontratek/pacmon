/**
 * The Pacmon mark, as the four images the editor draws before a dependency key.
 *
 * THE SHAPE is `media/pacmon-mark.svg`: three bars on an 8x8 grid, each bar
 * 6 wide and 2 tall, 1-unit gaps, the top bar 2 in from the left. Every edge
 * lands on a whole unit, so the mark is pixel-crisp at any multiple of 8 px.
 * At the 12 px it is drawn at, a bar is 3 px and a gap 1.5 px.
 *
 * FILLED means the dependency has a note; HOLLOW means it does not. The state
 * is carried by the shape, not by the colour — the one encoding that survives
 * colour blindness, and what keeps this out of WCAG 1.4.1's way. Colour is the
 * second channel: the two marks are also two stops apart in lightness (2.0:1
 * on Dark+, 2.1:1 on Light+), so they stay apart under full achromatopsia too.
 *
 * FOUR IMAGES because `contentIconPath` bakes the colour in — unlike
 * `contentText`, an image takes no ThemeColor. So each state is drawn twice,
 * and the decoration type's `light`/`dark` blocks pick between them. The light
 * greens are darker than the brand: #00ff66 on white is 1.4:1, unreadable.
 *
 * BASE64 rather than a plain UTF-8 data URI, because the fills are hex colours
 * and a bare `#` would start the URI's fragment and cut the image in half.
 * `btoa` (not `Buffer`) so this also runs in the web extension host; the SVG
 * is ASCII, which is all `btoa` accepts.
