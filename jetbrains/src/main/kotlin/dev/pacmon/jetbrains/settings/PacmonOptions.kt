package dev.pacmon.jetbrains.settings

/**
 * The values the Pacmon tool window and the Settings page may write, and the
 * words next to them. The VS Code extension keeps the same vocabulary in
 * `package.json` (`pacmon.noteButtons`, `pacmon.decorations`,
 * `pacmon.noteEntry`, `pacmon.inlineSource`) and the same help text in
 * `src/ext/strings.ts`; both editors are meant to offer the same choices under
 * the same names, so a note written in one reads the same in the other.
 *
 * The gestures differ on purpose. VS Code needs Ctrl+click for a document link
 * and an inlay hint; in the IntelliJ platform the inlay presentations take a
 * plain click, and only the package name itself — which is a go-to-declaration
 * target — needs the modifier.
