# Changelog

<!-- Write what changed under "Unreleased" as it lands, in the same pull request.
  Releasing (Actions -> Release -> Run workflow) renames that heading to the new
  version, uses the section as the release notes, and opens a fresh empty one.
  See docs/releasing.md. -->

## Unreleased

- **Fix: a setting in the Pacmon view could be set and stay unset.** The view
  shows each setting's effective value but wrote the user one, so a workspace
  value on top of it swallowed the click and the control snapped back with
  nothing to explain why — reachable through "Toggle Note Markers", which
  writes the workspace on purpose, and through any repository that ships these
  in its own `.vscode/settings.json`. Writes now land in the target that
  already defines the value, user settings otherwise. "Reset to Defaults"
  clears both, instead of leaving a workspace value standing after a reset.
- Fix: every switch in the view now has a name. The label around the track held
  no text, so a screen reader read an unnamed checkbox and the 30px track was
  the only place you could click; the words beside it are the label now, and
  the help line below is the description.
- Fix: the "Search dependencies…" action said it filtered "the list below".
  There is no list below — the view holds statistics, deliberately. It says
  what the action opens instead.
- Fix: `pacmon.noteButtons` claimed everything except `lightbulb` marks
  dependencies that have no note yet. `link` does not: it is drawn over every
  dependency name alike and only its tooltip tells the two apart — as the
  option's own description already said.
- The preview at the end of a `package.json` line runs to 90 characters
  instead of 48, so a first line of prose more often arrives whole.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-14

- **A note being read now looks like a note, not like an empty box.** In the
  note panel a layer at rest is text on the page — no frame, no fill.
  Hovering fills it the way VS Code fills a list row; the framed, filled box
  appears only while you are writing in it. The two are otherwise one box:
  the same floor however little the note says, and their text at the same x,
  so clicking into a layer draws the frame around the words without moving
  anything. Each layer carries a caption now — "Your
  note", "Agent notes" — since the frame is no longer there to name it, and
  "Your note" carries a small pen: the fill, the frame and the caret all wait
  for the mouse, so the pen is the only cue that says the text can be written
  in before you reach for it. It is drawn inline, because a webview under
  default-src 'none' cannot load the codicon font.
- **The mark replaces the pencil.** The glyph before a dependency name is now
  the Pacmon mark itself: filled when the dependency has a note, hollow when it
  does not. The state is carried by the shape rather than the colour, so it
  survives colour blindness; colour is the second channel, and the two marks
  are kept two stops apart in lightness on both editor themes (2.0:1 on Dark+,
  2.1:1 on Light+). Drawn at 12 px from four baked SVGs — two states, two
  themes — because an image attachment takes no `ThemeColor`.
- The activity bar icon is the mark too, replacing the generic document glyph
  that had nothing to do with the logo.
- Each state is its own decoration type instead of a per-dependency
  `renderOptions`. VS Code turns every distinct `renderOptions` object into its
  own dynamic CSS rule; two fixed types mean two rules and no per-dependency
  hashing, however long the dependency list.
- **The format is `dependency-notes/1`, in `.pacmon/DEPENDENCY-NOTES.md`.** The
  same layout as `deps-notes/1` in `.pacmon/DEPENDENCIES.md`; the names now say
  what the file holds, and the file name and the format name agree. A file
  that still says `deps-notes/1` gets an "unknown format" warning on that
  line, and a `.pacmon/DEPENDENCIES.md` is no longer read — rename it. The
  `agents:` frontmatter key is no longer written: it repeated the header
  comment. Existing lines are kept and ignored.
- **`.pacmon/AGENT-RULES.md` replaces `.pacmon/AGENTS.md`**, so the file no
  longer shares a name with the root `AGENTS.md`. It is a hand-written file
  shipped with the extension (`assets/AGENT-RULES.md`) and copied into the
  workspace, not generated from code.
- The pointer block in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and friends sits between
  `<!-- pacmon:start -->` and `<!-- pacmon:end -->`. Set Up AI Instructions
  still finds a block with the old markers and replaces it.
- `docs/format.md` is the reference for the format; `docs/example-repo/` is a
  complete example, lint-checked by the unit tests.
- The title of the notes file is `# Dependency Notes`, matching the file name.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-11

- New icon: the mark now sits on a dark disc, so it holds its shape against a
  light background as well as a dark one.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-11

Format round (2026-09-05):

- **`deps-notes/1` is a layered format.** The text right under `## name` is
  written by people and never parsed beyond its first line; `### Agent notes`
  holds `- key: value` lines written by AI agents (`purpose`, `usage`,
  `constraint`, `verify`, `log`, `verified`, plus `risk`, `runtime`,
  `exposure`, `bump-with`, `remove-when`, `alternatives`, `owner`, `status`,
  `links` when they apply); `### Generated` is reserved for a later release.
  The earlier flat draft of `/1` (`- why:` / `- caution:` bullets) was never
  released, so the version number stays and now means the layered format.
  Frontmatter gains `lang` (default `en`) and `agents`.
- **Everything Pacmon owns lives in `.pacmon/`.** Notes are
  `.pacmon/DEPENDENCIES.md` next to each package.json (nearest wins, as before);
  the rules agents follow are the generated `.pacmon/AGENTS.md` at the workspace
  root — created with the first note, regenerated by "Set Up AI Instructions",
  which now leaves only a three-line pointer in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md and
  friends. A root-level `DEPENDENCIES.md` is no longer recognized, and
  `pacmon.notesFile` is gone: the layout is part of the format.
- New setting **`pacmon.inlineSource`** (`human-first` default, `ai-first`,
  `human-only`, `ai-only`): which layer feeds the end-of-line preview and leads
  the hover. The hover always shows both layers, separated by a rule. Also a
  radio group in the Pacmon view.
- The note panel edits both layers: the human text in the main box, the agent
  block in a folded, editable box below it with a line count. The
  `- why:` / `- caution:` insert buttons went with the flat format.
- The header comment at the top of the notes file is owned by the format:
  three lines, rewritten by "Format DEPENDENCIES.md". Repository-wide rules go
  in the text between the title and the first section.
- A section kept for a package that left package.json (`- status: removed
  2026-06 — reason`) is no longer flagged as an orphan.
- Fix: the peek editor and the "empty input opens the file" path recreated the
  section with an empty body, wiping an existing note. Both now only make sure
  the section exists.
- Fix: writing a note right after `.pacmon/` was deleted could trust a stale
  cache entry (or a just-closed editor's copy) and skip the creation path. The
  writer now checks the disk.
- The note panel shows each layer rendered (VS Code's own Markdown engine,
  offline; a small fallback when that extension is disabled); click to edit,
  `Esc` when done, and it saves as you type — no Save button. The boxes size
  to their content, and a dependency without a note opens straight into
  writing. Rendered markup passes a sanitizer before it enters the page.
- The agent block is linted: a key outside the vocabulary gets an
  information diagnostic with two quick fixes (keep it as `- note: …`, or
  remove the line); empty values and malformed `runtime` / `exposure` /
  `status` / `verified` values are flagged too. The human text is never
  checked. `note` joins the vocabulary for anything that fits no other field.
  A misspelt key (`contraint`, `bump_with`, `notes`) gets "Change to …" as
  the preferred fix, and `source.fixAll.pacmon` rewrites every unknown key in
  one go — by hand with Fix All, or on save via `editor.codeActionsOnSave`.
- The note panel's read-mode box keeps the editor's size (about six lines)
  even when the note is empty, so an empty note is still visibly a box.
- Agent-block problems are now warnings (yellow, counted in the status bar,
  tinting the tab), underlined on the key or value alone, and made visible
  five ways: the message at the end of the line with a faint line tint, a
  code lens above the block ("⚠ 2 problems in this block — fix all"), a
  "⚠ 2" status bar item while the notes file is active, the problems listed
  under the agent box in the note panel with a Fix button, and the quick fix
  offered with the caret anywhere on the line. Still no notifications.
- A section whose package is not in package.json is no longer a diagnostic
  at all: it gets a yellow ⚠︎ before its heading — a marker, not a problem —
  because a removed package's notes are worth keeping and a marker does not
  nag. The hover names a near-miss dependency ("did you mean lodash?") or
  says the section is marked removed. Everything Pacmon still reports is a
  warning: one colour, one meaning.
- Headings are the format's: `# Dependencies` exactly once (the normalizer
  now writes it, like the header comment), `## name` per package, and inside
  a section only `### Agent notes`. A second `#`, another title, or a `###`
  heading in a section is flagged with "Make it plain text" (the words stay,
  bold) or, for `### Agent Note` / `### AI notes`, "Change to `### Agent
  notes`" — a misspelt agent heading used to make the whole block invisible.
- Also flagged: `status: removed` on a package that is still in package.json
  (remove the line), and a `format:` version this Pacmon does not read.
- A heading with nothing under it no longer counts as documentation: the
  coverage ratio, the `✎` glyph and the hover treat it as no note.
- `.pacmon/AGENTS.md` is now written by every note write, not only when the
  notes file itself is created — a repository can arrive with the one and not
  the other.

Feedback round (2026-09-03):

- **Primary note entry is now a note editor in a panel beside `package.json`**
  (Ghost Note-style): multi-line Markdown, `- why:` / `- caution:` insert
  buttons, Ctrl/Cmd+S to save, and in-memory drafts so unsaved text survives
  switching dependencies or hiding the panel. The webview loads nothing from
  disk or the network (`localResourceRoots: []`, CSP `default-src 'none'`).
  `pacmon.noteEntry`: `panel` (default) / `peek` / `input` / `inputBeside` /
  `comments`.
- Previously the primary entry was the embedded peek editor below the
  dependency line — still available as `pacmon.noteEntry: "peek"`.
- **Two clickable ways into a note from `package.json`** (`pacmon.noteButtons`):
  `iconLeft`, a glyph just before the package name that opens the note on a
  plain click and shows a hand cursor, and `link`, the package name itself on
  `Ctrl`+click. Both switchable; `[]` leaves package.json untouched and the
  right-click menu still works. `iconLeft` marks dependencies with no note yet,
  which is why it can be turned off.
- Fix: `pacmon.decorations: "off"` could do nothing. A hidden per-workspace flag
  outranked the setting entirely, and the fallback under it read
  `=== 'badge'`, so even `preview` only showed markers if that flag happened to
  be set. The setting is now the single source of truth, and "Toggle Note
  Markers" writes it (to the workspace) instead of a flag you cannot see.
- Fix: switching `link` on or off did nothing until the file changed.
  `DocumentLinkProvider` has no change event and VS Code caches what it
  returns, so returning an empty list cannot retract links — the registration
  is now created and dropped by hand.
- Changing any setting in the Pacmon view now brings `package.json` into view
  when none is on screen — as a preview tab, without taking focus, so a run of
  toggles stays a run of toggles. Every setting there changes how the manifest
  looks; hiding the result made the panel a blind box.
- The Pacmon view leads with **Coverage**: the documented/total ratio for the
  package.json you are in, a progress bar, and how many notes are still
  missing. Statistics only — which dependencies have notes is already visible
  on the manifest, so the view does not repeat the list.
  `Pacmon: Documentation Coverage` remains the browse-and-search path.
- New command **`Pacmon: Open package.json`**, the mirror of "Open
  DEPENDENCIES.md", and the notes-file action is now labelled with the actual
  configured file name instead of the words "notes file".
- **A Pacmon view in the activity bar**: a switch per click target with a live
  preview of what each does to a package.json line, radio groups for the note
  editor and the marker style, and the four commands. Built first as a tree and
  rebuilt as a webview — a tree gives you a label, a description and an icon,
  which is not enough to SHOW an option. Same guarantees as the note editor:
  `localResourceRoots: []`, CSP `default-src 'none'`, markup bundled, and an
  allowlist on the commands it may run.
  This softens the "no sidebar" line in the README: the view holds settings and
  commands only, never a list of your dependencies, and nothing opens it for you.
- Chosen out of a five-way comparison; the other three stay one checkbox away
  rather than being removed: CodeLens above the line
  (doubles the file's apparent height), an end-of-line inlay chip (competes with
  the note preview, needs Ctrl+click anyway), a lightbulb code action (two
  clicks). Only "a plain click anywhere on the line" was dropped outright — it
  took clicks meant for the text. `iconLeft` is a decoration rather than an
  inlay hint because only decorations expose `cursor`.
- Test fix (pre-existing flake): the context-menu invocation test read the
  notes file once, immediately after the command; the write lands on disk or
  through the open document's save depending on whether the previous test's
  restore has settled. It now waits for the content. Failed roughly 1 run in 3,
  now 5/5 green.
- Note panel reloads are generation-guarded, so retargeting faster than the
  file reads complete can no longer publish stale state.
- Context-menu invocation fixed (editor menus pass a Uri as the first
  argument); every command now reports failures to Output → Pacmon.

- Inline note **preview** on documented lines (first line of the note, truncated) — new default; `pacmon.decorations`: `preview`/`badge`/`off`.
- Single-line notes are now **edited inline** too (input box pre-filled); multi-line notes open in the file.
- Fixture workspaces ship with `npm.fetchOnlinePackageInfo: false`; README documents the setting (the "latest version / Loading…" hover content is VS Code built-in, not Pacmon).

Initial scope:

Initial version.

- Hover notes on `package.json` dependencies, sourced from `DEPENDENCIES.md` (`deps-notes/1` format).
- Subtle end-of-line marker on documented lines only.
- Add/Edit Dependency Note (right-click or command; creates the file with a template, inserts sections in alphabetical order).
- Format DEPENDENCIES.md (canonical ordering/headings; note bodies untouched).
- Documentation Coverage quick pick.
- Set Up AI Instructions (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / .cursor/rules / copilot-instructions.md).
- Gentle diagnostics on the notes file: orphan and duplicate sections.
- Monorepo support: nearest notes file wins (`pacmon.monorepo`).
- Fully offline; no telemetry; web-extension compatible (VS Code Web, Remote, dev containers).
